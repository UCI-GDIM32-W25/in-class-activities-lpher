# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## W1
### Activity 1
Our group came up with several tips:
1. First build is longest, more building, easier to build, build as early as possible.
2. Turn in something on time rather than nothing, you can work on it after and turn it in a day late and still receive an A.
3. Work on it if only for a couple minutes. Something is better than nothing. 
4. Go to office hours once every week or every other week.
5. Ask on discord “Questions” channel, questions you have may already be answered.
6. Playtest your own game more. Don’t be afraid to ask people to playtest your game.

### Activity 2
1. Value of x is 10
2. Value of x is 2
3. In the PrivateMessage () method, “hello world” is put in the console every frame because of the update method
4. Monobehaviour
5. At the start of the game, assigns 10 to x and therefore shows “x = 10” in the console
6. 10 is argument, int x is parameter 
7. There is no object in front of translate. Translate only works on object. Translate is being called on a class name
8. Use _playerTransform variable

I worked on setting up the game objects first, follwed by creating a script for the penguin as I wanted to work on player movement before anything else. For the game objects I set up their respective components like colliders for the floor, player, and coin. To create the core mechanic of the penguin jumping, I created an if statement for when ever the player presses down on the SPACE key.
